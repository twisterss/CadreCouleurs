# 3D parts for the frame

OpenSCAD has been used to build the 3D models.

## The box

It contains the electronics of the frame. It can easily by 3D-printed in two parts.

## The grid

It separates the LEDs. It can be either 3D-printed (STL files) or laser-cut (SVG file produced using Python).

It is better to print it in one part, but it can be printed in two parts.

## The holder

It is used to keep the grid inside the frame.
